# IEEE-754 Binary 64 Converter
This project provides a straightforward web-based tool designed to convert decimal and binary mantissa inputs to IEEE754 binary64 (double-precision) floating-point numbers. It handles special cases such as NaN (SNaN and QNaN), Infinity, and denormalized numbers, providing comprehensive coverage of the IEEE-754 standard.
